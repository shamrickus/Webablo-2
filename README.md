# Webablo-2
Diablo 2 "port" to web. As of right now, currently runs on TypeScript, Scss, Node (for the compiler), and HTML5. Uses Canvas to display, as the project matures will probably end up switching to web gl.

# Developing
1) Clone the repo<br>
2) Install Node.js<br>
3) Run npm install<br>
4) Run gulp build<br>
4.5) Repeat step 4 whenever a .ts or .scss file is changed<br>
5) Open main.html

#Disclaimer
I do not and will not ever provide actual diablo II assets as they are owned by Blizzard.
